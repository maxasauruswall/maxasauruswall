## Bio

I'm the one on the right in that picture (wearing the backpack, not riding in it). 

I'm a data scientist and software engineer, working for Moderna. Currently, I'm on academic leave until May 2024, studying math, systems biology, and type theory. I like to read, ski, draw cartoons, and garden.

More soon... under construction
