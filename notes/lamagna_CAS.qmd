[Computer Algebra Concepts and Techniques](https://www.routledge.com/Computer-Algebra-Concepts-and-Techniques/Lamagna/p/book/9781315107011)

Inspired by Chris Rackauckas' [call to action at the 2023 JuliaCon](https://www.youtube.com/live/vG6ZLhe9Hns?feature=share&t=4897) (and the use of Symbolics.jl logic in [Catalyst](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/), ModelingToolkit etc), I started reading this book August 15th.

Things I'm curious about: 

- What is a Groebner base, and why is it important?
